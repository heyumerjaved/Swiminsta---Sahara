In the midst of his chemotherapy journey, I sought to infuse some levity into his life. That's when we embarked on a delightful TV binge, starting with \"The Nanny\" featuring the incredible Fran Drescher, and journeyed through to \"Beautician and the Beast,\" and beyond. Laughter truly proved to be the most potent remedy! Fran, your ability to bring joy into our lives during this challenging time is beyond measure. It's an honor to allocate 15% of <em><strong>Swiminista.com\/CancerSchmance<\/strong><\/em>r sales towards supporting Cancer Schmancer.<\/p>",
